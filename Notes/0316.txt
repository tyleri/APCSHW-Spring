Last day to make tweaks and fixes for MyLinkedList

    - MyLinkedList.java should include the name() method
    - Create test conditions to determine if your linked
      list behaves properly
    - Implement generics in your linked list

Also, make sure to fix all previous assignments. They
will not be graded again after today.
