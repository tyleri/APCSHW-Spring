# APCSHW-Spring

A simple repository of all projects completed in Mr. Konstantinovich's AP Computer Science class at Stuyvesant High School.

* 01recursion: Simple tasks solved using recursion
* 02KnightsTour: A program that uses recursion and backtracking to solve the [Knight's Tour problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour)
* 03NQueens: A program that uses recursion and backtracking to solve the [N-Queens program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)
* 04USACO: Solutions to the 3/8/08 USACO Bronze problem #12 (Lake Making) and Silver problem #7 (Cow Travelling)
* 05MergeSort: An implementation of the merge sort algorithm and a program that compares the length of time needed to sort an array with the implementation vs. the length of time needed to sort an array with the Arrays.sort() method
* 06QuickSort: Implementations of the quick sort and quick select algorithms
* 07LinkedList: An implementation of the linked list data structure that uses node objects to contain the added data
* 09Stack: Implementations of the queue and stack data structures using the linked list created in 07LinkedList
* 10Deque: An implementation of the deque (double-ended queue) data structure that uses an array
* 11BFS: Implementations of depth-first search, breadth-first search, best-first search, and A\* search algorithms that can be used to solve a maze, uses the deque created in 10Deque
* 12TreeLab: Implementations of the binary tree and binary search tree data structures
* 13Heap: An implementation of the heap data structure that uses an array to hold values
* 14RunningMedian: An implementation of a data structure that allows you to get the median of a set of data in constant time, uses the heap created in 13Heap
* 15HeapSort: An implementation of the heap sort algorithm that uses the heap created in 13Heap
* Notes: Miscellaneous notes taken in class at the beginning of the semester
